## Milestone 6 - Test - Esi Mena

- What did i Do?

I created a HappyPath and Fail log.The "Happy Path" represents the ideal scenario where a user navigates through your application as intended, following the correct sequence of actions, and encounters no errors or issues.The "Fail Log" documents scenarios where users may encounter issues or errors. This includes cases where users accidentally misuse a feature, input incorrect data, or face unexpected errors. The purpose of the "Fail Log" is to identify potential pitfalls and ensure that your application handles errors gracefully or provides meaningful feedback to users.Looked up ai prompts on chatgpt and understand our project works with automated deployment.

- What are some challenges?

Trying to understand the automated deployment just because since it has already been done studying it took a bit longer time then doing it hands on to fully understand.

- Time?
