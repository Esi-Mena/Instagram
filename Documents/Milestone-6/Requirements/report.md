# Milestone 6 - Maxwell Seybert
## What did I do
This week for requirements I got everything ready for the 1.0 release. I fixed pretty much all remaining issues that were left in the code. I fixed:
- following
- followers
- navbar
- follow only feed
- made all buttons functional if they were not
- page to look at who a user is following and who follows them
- created options for our logo

I also set up the production server. After deployment I got people to use the app and in order to get customer feedback. 
Customer feedback - 

Kurtis - After some use, the over all use and feel is good. Things work like they should without issue. I think the login screen could be arranged differently to accommodate a phone vertical layout. I would also like to see how many comments are on a post.

Emily - Pixlpix is a fun platform. Itâ€™d be even better if there was a way to make a post with just words

Jason - The PixlPix website is an easy way to share and view pictures of friends. The interface is simple to use and understand. It quickly connected to my photo album and allowed me to seamlessly upload photos for friends to see. The ability to comment on others was great. 


Kieran - I really like the way the site looks, its clean and not to much. The site ran well and the UI was easy to figure out.

Rowan - The UI was highly intuitive. All the basic functions of the website worked well. It was nice to look at, being a good color combination and good design. 

There is an indepth issue list and burn down graph in attached presentation.
## Challenges
Development moved pretty straightfoward this milestone. Id say that the biggest challenge was setting up the production server but after adding a few things to the requirements file everything seemed to work well. 

## Time Spent
- 12 hours

## Video - need to add
