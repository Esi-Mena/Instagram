# Milestone 6 - Elfaz Mandefro
## What did I do
- For this week, I worked on defining and implementing key database management policies and practices for our Django Instagram clone app, focusing specifically on Data Integrity and Validation. This involved adding stringent validations and constraints to our models, such as UserProfile, Photo, Comment, and Like, to ensure the consistency and reliability of our database. The process was geared towards maintaining high data quality and preventing any data-related issues.

## Challenges
- Some challenges I faced this week were ensuring that the new validation logic seamlessly integrated with the existing application flow required careful consideration. Additionally, testing and confirming that all constraints functioned as intended without impacting the app's performance was time-consuming.
