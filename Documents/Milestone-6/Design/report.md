# Milestone 6 - Elfaz Mandefro
## What did I do

- This week, I worked on defining and implementing key database management policies and practices for our PixlPix app, focusing specifically on Data Integrity and Validation. This involved adding stringent validations and constraints to our models, such as UserProfile, Photo, Comment, and Like, to ensure the consistency and reliability of our database. The process was geared towards maintaining high data quality and preventing any data-related issues.

- This week, I worked on designing key operations processes for the PixlPix app. This included setting up an automated testing framework to enhance code quality and reliability. The focus was on writing unit and integration tests for critical components of the application, along with laying the groundwork for Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) using tools like Travis CI or GitHub Actions.

## Challenges

- Some challenges I faced this week were ensuring that the new validation logic seamlessly integrated with the existing application flow required careful consideration. Testing and confirming that all constraints functioned as intended without impacting the app's performance was also time-consuming.
  
- Some challenges I faced this week were making sure the automatic che­cks covered different situations and matched up with our app's features was a bit hard. Also, I had to be extra careful when bringing together the testing structure and the CI/CD pipeline due­ to some complicated steps. But this was critical for smooth and effective processes.
