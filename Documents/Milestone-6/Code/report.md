What I did for Milestone Six
- Fixed several small bugs with the website, such as user bios not showing up on your own profile, small graphical errors, or links leading to incorrect pages
- Tried out Github Copilot and wrote a review and writeup of my experience
- Fixed a major problem with the site with a lack of image previews or any feedback for uploading photos in the upload photos page

Challenges

I faced major and unexpected challenges in getting the website to run locally on my computer. For reasons I didn't know at the time, I suddenly needed to set up a whole database and I lost access to the posts and accounts that we were accessing locally. I think this turned out to be good in the end, as my bug testing led to me accidentally deleting a lot of posts, but it was still a frustrating experience.

- 1 and a half hours spent fixing simple bugs on the site
- 30 minutes spent setting up Github Copilot
- 4 hours spent working with Github Copilot, during which I fixed problems with the locally run website and implimented image previews
- 1 hour spent writing my Github Copilot review
