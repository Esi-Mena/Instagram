# Milestone 4 - Maxwell Seybert
## What did I do
This week I worked on adding all of the core features. The following features are all functional in our app. 


- User Creation
- User Profile
- User Profile editing
- User posts
- User homepage to see posts in order of newest to oldest
- Posts show user who posted and caption
- Posts have link to user's profile who posted. 
- Search functionaliiy to find other users on the site


Core features we still need


- Like
- Follow
- Comment
- Photo detail
- Follow only feed


I worked on views/templates/urls to add these features. The views I made last week were mostly functional but I did need to tweak somethings here and there in order for it to work correctly. I did find that working with test driven development and only doing one thing at a time greatly improved my effeciency. I also found that all of the set up work I did last week was very helpful in making this weeks work easier. I did also add some simple css in the form of bootstrap to make the site look better. However, We might change the css into something that looks more unique than bootstrap. 
## Challenges
I am still waiting on my group to complete Following, liking and commenting from milestone 3. We met and discussed that if they did not finish the development of these features by a certain time I would help them finish developing these features if needed. The photo detail and follow feed will be created after like, follow and commenting as these two features depend on the ones that have not been added yet. There is also the issue of profile pictues. For some reason profile picutres are not saving properly therefore they do not show. I would like to fix this at some point but I think priority should be on finishing the core features. 


The biggest issue we currently face is hosting. At the start of this milestone out build and deploys would fail. I did a good amount of debugging for this and now our build and deploy show as successful. However when we try to access our domain that we are hosted on railway states that our application is not responding. I read all of the railway documentation on this issue and spent a good amount of time trying to fix it. After trying every solution in the railway documentation our application still does not respond. We have decided that we are going to look into another hosting solution since I cannot seem to figure out the issue with the current hosting since both are build and deploy are stated to be succesful.

## Time Spent
