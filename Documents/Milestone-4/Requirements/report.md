# Milestone 4 - Elfaz Mandefro
## What did I do
- I successfully established a comprehensive Defect Tracking and Resolution system using GitHub Issues. I ensured the system was tailored to our project's specific needs and provided training to the team, ensuring seamless adoption and integration into our workflow. This initiative has significantly enhanced our ability to log, prioritize, and resolve defects, ensuring a higher quality output as we progress towards the completion of this milestone."
- I  structured our development timeline into sprints, ensuring that each sprint is balanced with features and tasks to optimize our team's productivity and focus.
- I implemented a dynamic burn-down graph that visualizes our team's future progress throughout each sprint. This tool has been helpful in tracking our performance and making necessary adjustments to stay on course.
