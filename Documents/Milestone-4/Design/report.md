# Milestone 4 - Design - Esi Mena
- What did i do?
I added more to the views such as photo_delete, photo_update, and photo_list and made adjustments to the rest of the to make these views work such as working on the
forms.py file and adding urls to the urls.py file. I also created some simple html templates for the photo_delete, photo_update, and photo_list. I reviewd the files to see if they were in an organized way and accessing them is easy.

- What are some challenges?
  Some of the views and models were already created so i had to go back and double check to see if i accidently made a view that did the same function  becuase if so,
  then this would have caused errors with the code when it comes to test and running it. Also having to review the code that already existed becuase understanding it from reading is a bit more difficult to understand then from actually typing it out.
