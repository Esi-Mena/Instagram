What I did for milestone 4
- Determined the current test coverage to be at 91%
- Did a manual test of the website to find bugs and problems that may not have been caught by our testing code
- Reviewed our data views tests that were made during milestone 3 to make sure they were up to date and working properly based on manual testing
