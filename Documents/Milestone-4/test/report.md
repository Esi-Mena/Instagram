What I did for milestone 4
- Determined the current test coverage to be at 91%
- Did a manual test of the website to find bugs and problems that may not have been caught by our testing code
- Reviewed our data views tests that were made during milestone 3 to make sure they were up to date and working properly based on manual testing

Tasks to be done by testing in milestone 5
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
For milestone 5 test will need to conduct a usability test with another team in this class. In addition they'll need to implement improvements to testing based on team feedback and collaborate with the requirements role to create a presentation for the client updating them on the project's progress.

I had no idea how testing worked in Django before doing this milestone, but fortunately my research for milestone 3 allowed me to understand the testing code much faster than I had the views and models code. I was also a bit confused on what to do since we had already implemented tests for data views before milestone 3 was even due. I ended up doing a lot of review of the testing code through my research and also did some bug hunting manually since our website has been rapidly changing over the past few weeks.

- 1 and a half hours spent getting the total test coverage for the project
- 1 and a half hours spent researching Django testing and reviewing our own tests
- 30 minutes spent doing a manual test of the website and writing down bugs
