# Milestone 3 - Maxwell Seybert
## What did I do
For milestone three I worked on creating the views and tests for the views. I also created all of the data models for our project. I also created all of the html template files however not all of them are "filled in" with the correct forms and such. We should have all of the views we need in order for the project to work but they will still probably be tweaked here and there. Initially I tried to create new views but in the current project we already had in deployment. I also created new models in the old project and all of these changes led to issues that I will discuss later. After lack of success from this attempt I decided to just start a new project and build it out from scratch since that is essentially what was happening anyway. After doing that I got a prototype with Account creation, login and logout being successful. Again not without issue. I have python tests in place for the features of our app that do not work yet so currently all the tests fail. After I restarted the project from scratch I pushed it into deployment but it is currently having some issues being deployed so that is also something that I am working to fix. 
## Challenges
When initally trying to just create the views in the old project I ran into many issues with the models not wanting to make migrations and the views just not working in general. After this I decided to move into developing it again from scratch since we were basically ripping the old code from the old project and recreating everything anyway. I started from scratch developing step by step one thing at a time. Initailly this was working. The user can go to the site, register with an account, login to said account, logout of said account, and upload a photo to post. Currently there is no CSS in the site so it doesnt look pretty but that can be fixed later right now I am only worried about having functiionality. I did try to create a home feed which does work technically to show users posts. However, for some reason the photos uploaded do not show up on the home feed but the alt text does so I think that there is an issue with the way the photo is being accessed but Im not sure. Also I tried to create the user profile page but that is met with an error I have not been able to figure out how to fix. I did overcome some challenges in the user login page as initally the page would not recognize if the user was already logged in and then would break everything. The same issue occured in the home page. The deployment is also broken but I am not surpised by this as I changed the entire app in the github repo. However, many attempts have been made to fix this and I am confused as to why it isnt working but I am working on it.
