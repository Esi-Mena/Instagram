# Development Guide - Maxwell Seybert
The development guide that I think would work best with how we are doing this project comes as follows
## Core Features
1. Account creation
2. Login to accounts and logout
3. The ability to make posts with captions
4. A home page to see posts
5. A user profile page
6. The ability for following other users
7. The ability to like posts
8. Search function to find other users
9. Comments on posts
## Other features
10. Discover feed
11. Notifications
12. Block other users
13. Dark Mode
## Notes
I think if we develop each feature one at a time and then continue to develop step by step it will help us be successful. I also think we should prioritize functionality first and then make it look pretty after we have functionality.
