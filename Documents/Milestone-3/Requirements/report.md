# Milestone 3 - Requirments - Esi Mena
- What did I do?

In Milestone 3 I have created a product backlog (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15XaNn_x1CyB53_GY2H1psTrvlK5OdZWoQ01nxTDefXY/edit?usp=sharing) where i  entered user stories in the format of As User... I would like to... So that and i included the priority features of the user story and if those features have been completed or not. I then use chat gpt for an ai prompt to find the core features of the app. Based on the core features it gave back i used those for my product backlog.I then wrote a client report describing to the client what my team has done so far and keeping up to date the problems we are having and how we are going to fix those problems and explain what we will be starting next. I communicated with the rest of my team to see what they have did and or what they have planned wich i included in the clients report. We will be focusing on how others can make comments and give likes and start the proccess of users following one another. 

- What are some challenges?

Some challenges were trying to upload the product backlog on github because i couldnt copy or past the information into the file becuase it would lose the format of the product backlog wich would have made it confusing for others trying to view the backlog
