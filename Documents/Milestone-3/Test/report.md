# Milestone 3 - Elfaz Mandefro
## What did I do
This week, I focused on implementing Test-Driven Development (TDD). I created several tests, fully expecting some of them to fail because while the views are in place, the UI for those views hasn't been implemented yet. It was a productive exercise, that would help save time later as we refine these tests when the UI is updated in the coming days.
## Challenges
This week, I didn't get my work done in time. I had some personal stuff and health matters that took up my time. When I did get to work, I ran into the usual bumps like making some syntax errors and sometimes just getting stuck on how to do certain things. I also spent some time learning about Test-Driven Development (TDD). It's a new thing for me, so I'm still getting the hang of it, but I was able to make progress and add 7 more tests to the ones we had.
