What I did for Milestone Three
- Researched Dijango to learn how to adapt our prexisting code to our new website
- Implimented likes, follows, and finished implimenting the detailed photo screen to add and view comments
- Had meetings with other team members to help with locally running the website and understanding the code base

Code will be responsible for working with the test role to get our site's test coverage up to 80%, make sure our tests are efficient, and building the ground work for efficient bug solutions

Challenges and Concerns
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
This milestone was very difficult for me as I was working with an unfamiliar platform with Django with an already existing code base that I had very little understanding of. In addition we were facing many technical problems around this time that made accessing the website difficult and was keeping our code on Github from being up to date. However, I continued trying to learn and talked with my teammates and eventually I was able to reach a breakthrough in my understanding of the code and finished the milestone in early October.

Time Investment

- 4 hours spent researching how Django works
- 2 hours spent meeting with my team
- 1 and a half hours spent getting the website to run locally on my computer
- 2 hours spent implimenting likes, during which I also implimented the detailed photo view
- 1 and a half hours spent implimenting follows
- 1 hour spent polishing features once I had implimented them
