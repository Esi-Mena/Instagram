# AI Prompts used for milestone 2

- Write a Django app to upload images to a server
-The most useful part of this response was step 7 which involved creating the views for the server. However the earlier steps were also useful in giving context to the code so I could better interpret it to reference for PixlPix's views.
- Create a simple app patterned after Instagram with Django
-The response I got for this prompt was actually a lot more helpful for Milestone 3 code then it was for Milestone 2 design. It gave me a step by step guide for making posts, likes, and comments. I will likely be referencing this prompt for both this milestone and milestone 3 going forward.
