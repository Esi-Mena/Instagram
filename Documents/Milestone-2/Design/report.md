What I did for Milestone Two
- Wrote a data outline that gave all the data objects that would need to be created along with their associated variables
- Determined the necessary views for each object (whether they need to be able to be created, updated, deleted, and viewed in lists or in detail)
- Meet with my team to make sure the data types I laid out were considered necessary and whether or not I missed anything
