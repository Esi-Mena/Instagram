What I did for Milestone Two
- Wrote a data outline that gave all the data objects that would need to be created along with their associated variables
- Determined the necessary views for each object (whether they need to be able to be created, updated, deleted, and viewed in lists or in detail)
- Meet with my team to make sure the data types I laid out were considered necessary and whether or not I missed anything

Tasks to be done by design in Milestone Three
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
In milestone 3 it will be the job of design to impliment refactoring into the coding process in order to weed out and solve coding issues before they become serious problems. As such design will need to work closely with code in working directly with the program to make sure everything works as intended.

Challenges and Concerns

I'm a bit worried about how deleting users and posts will function since it will affect data for a lot of users and parts of the website. Personally I don't have much experience implimenting these sorts of features so it's very possible many of these will be more complex to code than they may seem right now. With so many moving parts it'll take a lot of testing to make sure different features don't break each other when they interact.
