# Milestone 1
## Maxwell Seybert - Requirements
### What I did for Mileston 2
- For milestone 2 I worked to create a list of 20 features that we will aim to have in our project. I did this by first researching what features instagram has and then seeing what features were essential and which others did not seem essential to develop first. I then started to look at the requirements and think about the time restraint and scope that would be possible from our team within the semester and began to essentially "trim" the initial list of features that instagram has. This approach actually made it very straightforward to create the future enhancements list as I already had a decent list of features that I did not think would fit in the scope of our project, but if given a large amount more of time would be good features to implement. I then only had to worry about finding a few new features for future enhancement instead of finding 20 new entire features. 

### Concerns and Challenges
- I thing my biggest concern is that our feature list might be too much. While I do think it is feasable for us to finish all 20 requirements I stated I am worried that certain requirements may be more of a challenge then anticipated. For example I worry that things such as likes, follows, and the two different feeds may end up being more complicated than we are anticipating but I am hoping for the best.
