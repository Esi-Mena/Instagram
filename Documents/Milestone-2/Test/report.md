# Milestone 2- Test- Esi Mena
- What did I do?

In Milestone 2, I've developed a script with the purpose of testing a specific web page. The script is configured to target the URL "https://instagram-production.up.railway.app" and verify the presence of a predefined text, which, in this instance, is "List of Heroes." It initiates the process by sending an HTTP GET request to the designated URL, subsequently examining the response status code to ensure a successful request (indicated by code 200). Upon success, the script proceeds to parse the HTML content of the page, extracting all the textual content. It then conducts a search within this extracted content to determine whether the expected text is present. If the expected text is identified, the script confirms that the web page contains it. However, if the expected text is absent, the script generates a report indicating its absence. In the event of a request failure, the script provides an error message, accompanied by the received status code. In essence, this script serves as a tool to validate the presence of the specified content on the targeted web page.

- What are some challenges?

When trying to clone the repository to my visual studio code it was a bit difficult becuase it was saying that it could not find the file or that there were errors when fetcching the repository and this was when i tried doing it through the terminal so instead i did the side menu and use the source control to clone the repo.
