# Milestone i
## Elfaz Mandefro - Code
### What I did for Milestone 2
- For milestone two I was in charge of implementing and deploying a simple prototype that shows the most important feature of the code. For our project, the most important feature is to be able to upload photos to the server and I was able to get that done. 
### Concerns and Challenges
- one of the challenges I faced was deciding if I wanted to modify the project we already had or start a new project. Upon discussing it with Chatgpt I decided that it would be easier and more feasible to create a new project. 
### Engineering Investment
- 5 Hours
