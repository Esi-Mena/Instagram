- What did i do?

I have created a Product Upgrade where i went through our website Pixlpix and studied to find 3 features that are not working properly, 3 feature we need to update, and 3 features we could include, I also use the tool of ai to help me benefit, and describe why these feature are a good idea or how to fix these features. I then also had chatgpt go into more detail and summary about these features. I then had someone go through our website and gives a review on what we are doing well and what we need to fix or add.

  Some Challenges that I had was trying to figure out some features to update or create new features because we already have so many features implemented.
