# Milestone 7 - Elfaz Mandefro
## What did I do

- This week, I developed comprehensive security documentation for the PixlPix app, which included creating a detailed Security Review Checklist, an in-depth Security Assessment Report, and an Engineering Investment Summary tailored to the app's specific needs

## Challenges

- My challenges this week were centered around ensuring that the security measures addressed all potential vulnerabilities specific to the PixlPix app's Django-based architecture and aligning them with industry best practices, while also considering the resource allocation for implementation and maintenance.
