## What Did I do 
For this milestone I worked to complete the needed reports(dev ops and data managment). I also helped Elfaz fix a couple bugs with the recent design overhaul that she did. I also looked into and attempted to set up a storage space but unfortunatley was unable to figure it out in the time I had left in the semester. 
## Challenges
There were certain aspects of the dev ops and datamangagement report that I was not very familliar with and I needed to do research to complete them. The biggest challenge was the storage space because I could not find many resources on the internet to be able to configure it correctly and was unable to do so in the end.
