## What Did I do 
For this milestone I worked to complete the needed reports(dev ops and data managment). I also looked into and attempted to set up a storage space but unfortunatley was unable to figure it out in the time I had left in the semester. 

For the v1.1 release I helped fix some bugs caused by the design overhaul. I fixed the following issues stemming from the design overhaul
- hosting went down(fixed)
- Following page does not work (fixed)
- Certain pages do not have new design(fixed)
- bugs with looking at who a user is following (fixed)
## Challenges
There were certain aspects of the dev ops and datamangagement report that I was not very familliar with and I needed to do research to complete them. The biggest challenge was the storage space because I could not find many resources on the internet to be able to configure it correctly and was unable to do so in the end.
## Time spent
