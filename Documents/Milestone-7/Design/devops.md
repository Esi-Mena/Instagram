# PixlPix Devops
## Introduction
Pixlpix is an social media web-abb made for users to share images. It is written in python using django. The web server and hosting are both handled using the digital ocean platform. The goal for pixlpix is to add more features with new ways for the users to connect with eachother while also maintaining and improving current features. 
## Development Procedures
### Github
The development takes place on the github repo, if you are planning on developing a large feature it would be best if the repo was branched and then developed fully until implemented. When simply fixing bugs and working on small features, just working with a clone of the repo is acceptaple. Just be sure to keep the github and your local machine in sync as to avoid merge errors. 
### Coding Practice
To keep the coding practice simple, keep code as efficent as possible, and leave comments on code at the very least explaining what the section of code is doing. It is recommended that whomever is writing code should leave a good amount of comments explaining what the code is doing, and how the code itself works incase of errors with the code. 
### Testing 
Along with writing code, coders should write tests along side the code they are writing to prevent errors and bugs as much as possible. Developers should always follow test driven development. Test code should be 50% of the code total, and cover 90% of the application. These numbers are a not a requirement but should be within 5% as best practice. 
## Deployment Procedures
All code should be deployed to the github. Once a test server is up, there should never be any undeployed code unless the developer is actively writing the code. Even if the code does not work and there are errors it should be pushed when the developer is done working to avoid merge errors and to allow for other developers to see what is being done and help fix it. Digital ocean will automatically push changes into production. Once the test server is set up changes will first go to a test server to ensure that everything is working properly then pushed to the production deployment. 
## Issues
### Issue Logging 
All issues will be logged into the build-in issues tab of github. Q&A developers should work to both find this issues and flag them and help resolve them when needed. When opening an issue, the following information is to be provided: Name of Issue, location of issue in the code(if known), a very detailed description of the issue, how it was found, and the date found. When an issue is resolved the following information must be provided: Date resolved, how the issue was resolved, location of the issue in the code, and how the fix could effect other features. All issues should be resolved as quickly as possible. 
### Issue Types
Issues will be defined in the following levels. Level 3 - a very minor issue where the app still runs, but a minor feature may not work as expected. Level 2 - a minor feature does not work, or a major feature is not working properly. Level 1 - A major feature is not working and the app is not functioning. 
### Response time to Issues
Level 3 - issues should be fixed within a few days but development should still proceed as planned.

Level 2 - issues should be fixed as soon as possible but development should still proceed but be slowed in order to fix the issue. 

Level 1 - Development should halt and devlopers should only work to fix the issue until it is resolved. 
## Conclusion 
Developers should follow these guidelines as best practice when developing pixlpix.
