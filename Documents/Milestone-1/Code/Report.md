# Milestone 1- Code- Esi Mena
-What did I do?

I've established a GitHub repository named "Instagram" as the designated platform for submitting our project, known as "PixlPix." Furthermore, invitations have been extended to each member of the group, affording them the privilege of collaborator access to this repository.

Within our shared documents folders, categorized into segments like code, design, test, and requirements, provisions have been made for the organized submission of our work and reports pertinent to the respective milestones. To enhance clarity, an application description has been included, encapsulating both the features and an overarching summary of the PixlPix project's essence and content.

-What will I do? Code for Milestone 2

my plan involves modifying the project shared by Max from his web development class. This adjustment will serve as a foundation, facilitating its alignment with the visual and functional aspects reminiscent of an Instagram-like format.
