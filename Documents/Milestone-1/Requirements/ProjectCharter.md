PixlPix Project Charter

Goals and Objectives

Our focus is on achieving the basics of an Instagram-esque social media site, which are outlined in the scope section of this charter. These features should be fully functional without any major bugs that disrupt the user experience.

Scope and Deliverables
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
We'll focus on the core features of a social media website, primarily posts, interactions, and scrolling. Posting includes the ability to submit text, images, and videos to the website that are connected to your account and can be seen by other users. Interaction covers how other users can respond to your posts through liking, commenting, and sharing them with others. Scrolling is done through a chronological feed where users can see other posts in an infinitely scrolling feed that reaches from the latest site post to the first. We'll also implement the hashtag feature where users can tag their post using a # symbol and other users can use a search function to find posts with that tag. The site should be able to automatically generate new tags when a user uses one for the first time. Users will also be able to create an account which they can log in and out of and follow other users.

Stakeholders

Since this is a class project, our primary stakeholder is our professor Mark Seaman. All of the developers/group members are also stakeholders in the project since we have a vested interest in the project going well for both our grades and our last stakeholder. This last stakeholder is potential future employeers since if this project is of high enough quality we can put it on our resumes as a way to show off our abilities.
