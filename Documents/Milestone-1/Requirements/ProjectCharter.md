PixlPix Project Charter

Goals and Objectives

Our focus is on achieving the basics of an Instagram-esque social media site, which are outlined in the scope section of this charter. These features should be fully functional without any major bugs that disrupt the user experience.

Scope and Deliverables
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
We'll focus on the core features of a social media website, primarily posts, interactions, and scrolling. Posting includes the ability to submit text, images, and videos to the website that are connected to your account and can be seen by other users. Interaction covers how other users can respond to your posts through liking, commenting, and sharing them with others. Scrolling is done through a chronological feed where users can see other posts in an infinitely scrolling feed that reaches from the latest site post to the first. There will also be a following feed which is similar to the chronological feed except it only shows posts from users the user is following. We'll also implement the hashtag feature where users can tag their post using a # symbol and other users can use a search function to find posts with that tag. The site should be able to automatically generate new tags when a user uses one for the first time. Users will also be able to create an account which they can log in and out of and follow other users.

Stakeholders

Since this is a class project, our primary stakeholder is our professor Mark Seaman. All of the developers/group members are also stakeholders in the project since we have a vested interest in the project going well for both our grades and our last stakeholder. This last stakeholder is potential future employeers since if this project is of high enough quality we can put it on our resumes as a way to show off our abilities.

Timeline and Budget
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Timeline: Our timeline will follow the process set by the milestone system used in this assignment, so features will be implimented in tandem with these milestone due dates. In terms of priorities, we're aiming to impliment features in this order:
- Posting text and images to the site, which will remain on the server even after leaving the page. The chronological feed will be implimented to the necessary extent to test this feature
- Being able to interact with posts through likes and comments. Sharing may be implimented depending on how we initally impliment the post feature
- A fully implimented chronological scrolling feed with either pages with a number of posts on them or ideally an infinitely scrolling feed along with the option to switch to a following only feed
- Profiles will be developed throughout the process but at this point logging in and out should be functional along with posts, likes, and comments being associated with their appropriate accounts
- Tagging will be added last along with searching through tags and automatically generating new ones when users use them
- After all these features are implimented additional features from Instagram may be considered
- The structure of the milestone development process means that all of these features will be developed and refined throughout the process

Budget: Assuming an approximately $60 cost for each hour of work, along with an estimated completion time of 500 hours, our first estimate comes at about $30,000. However, the engineers working on this project aren't very experienced with large scale development, and may require more training in the used programs in order to make progress. I estimate this will add about 50 to 75 hours of additional work to the project, increasing the estimate to $33,000 to $34,500 in total.
