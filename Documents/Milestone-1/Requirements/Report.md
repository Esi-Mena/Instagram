What I did for Milestone One
- Met with my team twice during class in order to discuss the project. During this time we worked together to decide on our hosting website, application name, and our goals for the project and I worked to keep the conversation on track and clarify various aspects of the project where they may have been unclear
- Created a project charter that outlines key aspects of the project such as base features and stakeholders
- Set up multiple lines of communication such as a text message group and a Google doc for listing potential feature ideas

Tasks to be done by requirements in Milestone Two

For the next milestone requirements will be outlining the architechture and user interface of PixlPix. This will include a detailed document describing how the application will work without the exact coding detail. The user interface, technology used, and architechture will all be sufficently decided on and described here.

Challenges
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
My biggest challenge has been writing out a timeline for the project, as I have a lack of experience implimenting these sorts of features especially on websites. We also had some trouble deciding on a name for the project and iterated on it several times before reaching PixlPix.
