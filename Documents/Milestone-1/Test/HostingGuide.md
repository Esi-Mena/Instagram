# Hosting Guide
- We are using railway and no on in the group has used this platform before so I will not have much to put here but I can put what I currently know and then add to it when we learn more.
- Railway connects directly to our github and automatically deploys updates when we update the github repo
- We can change lots of the settings in the railway hosting by logging into railway with Esi's github accounts and then going to the app management page. 
- We can add variables in the variables tab
- We can change our domain in the settings area. 
- railway will send an email if a deployment fails
