# Engineering Report

## Milestone 1 - Design - Elfaz Mandefro

* What did I do?
    * I discussed with my team members and we agreed that using Django would be the optimal choice, given our collective experience with the framework.
    * For setting up the development tools, we didn't need to introduce any new training to the group because we had previously worked on a project in another class (BACS350). Therefore, we collectively decided to use that project as our starting point.
    * We will also be using OpenAI tools to leverage AI for content generation and automation. 
* What will I do?  Design for Milestone 2
    * For Milestone 2, if I continue to hold the design role, I'm not entirely sure about the exact expectations, but I believe the next logical steps would involve integrating OpenAI into the app, identifying the necessary packages, and getting started on the development process. 
    * Need to get an Open AI key
* Engineering investment
    * One hour and a half discussion with team members.
    * Three hours relearning Django.
    * 1 hour of research to identify the benefits of Django and other tools we might need.
* 5-minute Video Demo
    * I may record a video later but am skipping it for now
