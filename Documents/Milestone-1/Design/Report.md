## Milestone 1 - Design - Elfaz Mandefro

* What did I do?
    * I discussed with my team members and we agreed that using Django would be the optimal choice, given our collective experience with the framework.
    * For setting up the development tools, we didn't need to introduce any new training to the group because we had previously worked on a project in another class (BACS350). Therefore, we collectively decided to use that project as our starting point.
* What will I do?  Design for Milestone 2
    * For Milestone 2, if I continue to hold the design role, I'm not entirely sure about the exact expectations, but I believe the next logical steps would involve identifying the necessary packages, creating a prototype, and getting started on the development process.
* Challenges
    * We encountered some minor challenges, one of which was deciding whether to incorporate a separate frontend platform like React alongside Django. Following a team discussion, we determined that this might pose significant challenges and opted to continue with Django as our standalone choice. 
* Engineering investment
    * One hour and a half discussion with team members.
    * Three hours relearning Django.
    * 1 hour of research to identify the benefits of Django and other tools we might need.
* 5-minute Video Demo
