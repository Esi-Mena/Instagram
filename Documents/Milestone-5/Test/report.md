# Milestone 4 - Maxwell Seybert
## What did I do
I had a report here but for some reason it dissapeared (I think due to a merge error) so I am going to make a new one. In milestone 5 I was assigned to test. We currently have 85% test coverage which is pretty closed to the 90% that is desired. I spent most of my time on milestonen 5 working on fixing the hosting. Hosting is now fixed and on digital ocean. I also did the usability test for clipboard. 
## Challenges
The biggest issue was fixing the hosting. I spent a lot of time configuring the yaml file and tweaking things in our app settings. I was eventually able to get it all fixed though and we are now sucessfully hosted. 

## Time Spent
- 10 hours
