# Milestone 5 - Maxwell Seybert
## What did I do
This week I worked on testing our code. We have kept up pretty well on testing and after this milestone we are at 85% test coverage. What I have mostly been working on though this week is fixing the hosting. We have moved over to digital ocean and I am working on setting it up. Hosting is now functional. I fixed hosting on digital ocean by continuously changing the yaml file and checking the settings and wsgi file. I used Marks 

I also created the usability test for clipboard. I met with them and discussed things that I found were good and things that needed improvement. I also wrote a report on the test that can be found in the documents for milestone 5.

## Challenges
I think it may be a bit of a challenge to increase our testing percentage from 85% as we already have 12 tests that cover a lot of our code, however I do think it could be possible to increase it there will just be a large amount of test overlap. 

The biggest challenge is still setting up the hosting. I have fixed many problems but am still running into more issues when setting it up. I will probably ask for help to finish it but hopefully hosting should be up soon
