## Milestone 5- Code - Esi Mena
- What did I do?
  
  I have created a test log explaing the steps and whether they were pass or fails of the new features i added to the project. The new features i included is making
  where the user can edit there picutre that is uploaded such as changing there caption and saving those changes. Within the edit i also gave the user an option to delete
  the post aswell. I also made it where they can now upload a profile picture and it will display above there username.I also changed the name to the like button  to checkout
  profile because it would take the user to the profile of the users photo instead so that instead i added a like button at the home page wich would actually increment the likes in the
  profile page aswell.

 - What are some challenges?

   Some challenges were trying to figure out the like homepage button becuase the views for likes wasnt connecting with the like for the hompage and i though i would be
   able to use the same view becuase it was doing the same purpose so then i thought i might have to make some javascript code but it didnt make sense too me becuase when someone make the like
   functionlity it just showed they added a view, form, and url, etc  so it took me a while to realize i need to add a seperate view for the hompage like button wich i did
   wich ended up working.
