What I did for Milestone Five
- Prepared a presentation on the status of our project, including a presentation made in Microsoft Powerpoint and and list of issues sorted into 3 different categories
- Created a burndown graph showing our progress on the website, including estimates for the completion times of issues solved in the past in order to more accurately predict the future of the project
- Gave a usability test where a test person from another group came over and tested our website to give us a fresh perspective on it
- Gave a presentation to our client covering the information I prepared, which included a demonstration of the website

Challenges

I wouldn't say I faced major issues creating this presentation, but the burndown graph was the hardest part of it. Since I didn't remember how to put the information into Microsoft Excel in order to make a graph, I ended up creating a graph from scratch which took a long time to finish. Additionally I had to change the graph to account for new information and even doing that it was still outdated by presentation time. I also had to account for the limitation of treating each issue as equal when issues can take different amounts of time, which I solved by sorting the issues list into categories based on complexity and estimated time to fix.
