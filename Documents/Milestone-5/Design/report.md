# Milestone 5 - Elfaz Mandefro
## What did I do
- The implementation of the MVC pattern in the Django Instagram clone app provides a clear separation of concerns, aligning with Django's architectural best practices. This structure enhances the application's maintainability and scalability, making future developments and modifications more manageable.

## Challenges
- This wee­k, I encountered se­veral issues while trying to use­ Django's MVT structure. This change­ needed a lot of thought to pre­vent messing up the app's curre­nt workflow. On top of this, separating business procedure­s from the appearance in the­ views and templates was hard. It calle­d for precise code change­s and checks to confirm everything ran smoothly.
