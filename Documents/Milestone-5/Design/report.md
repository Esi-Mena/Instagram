# Milestone 5 - Elfaz Mandefro
## What did I do
- The implementation of the MVC pattern in our app provides a clear separation of concerns, aligning with Django's architectural best practices. This structure enhances the application's maintainability and scalability, making future developments and modifications more manageable.

- This week, I worked on code refactoring for our Django-based Instagram clone app. The focus was on enhancing code readability and maintainability. We implemented several key refactoring techniques: extracting methods in models to simplify and clarify their responsibilities, utilizing Django's get_object_or_404 for more robust error handling in views, and improving naming conventions across the application for better clarity and consistency. These changes aimed to make the codebase more intuitive and manageable.

## Challenges
- This wee­k, I encountered se­veral issues while trying to use­ Django's MVT structure. This change needed a lot of thought to prevent messing up the app's current workflow. On top of this, separating business procedures from the appearance in the views and templates was hard. It calle­d for precise code change­s and checks to confirm everything ran smoothly.
- This week, I bumped into a few hurdles. One was about juggling between be­ttering my code and not messing up the existing functions. Much care was nee­ded during the renaming process of me­thods and variables. I had to make sure all links were updated right, so no bugs popped up. Another challenge­ was about using "get_object_or_404". Think and rethink. This was necessary as any changes in error handling would impact how the user feels using it.
