# Milestone 5 - Elfaz Mandefro
## What did I do
- The implementation of the MVC pattern in the Django Instagram clone app provides a clear separation of concerns, aligning with Django's architectural best practices. This structure enhances the application's maintainability and scalability, making future developments and modifications more manageable.

- For this week, I worked on code refactoring for our Django-based Instagram clone app. The focus was on enhancing code readability and maintainability. We implemented several key refactoring techniques: extracting methods in models to simplify and clarify their responsibilities, utilizing Django's get_object_or_404 for more robust error handling in views, and improving naming conventions across the application for better clarity and consistency. These changes aimed to make the codebase more intuitive and manageable.

## Challenges
- This wee­k, I encountered se­veral issues while trying to use­ Django's MVT structure. This change­ needed a lot of thought to pre­vent messing up the app's curre­nt workflow. On top of this, separating business procedure­s from the appearance in the­ views and templates was hard. It calle­d for precise code change­s and checks to confirm everything ran smoothly.
- This wee­k, I bumped into a few hurdles. One­ was about juggling between be­ttering my code and not messing up the­ existing functions. Much care was nee­ded during renaming process of me­thods and variables. I had to make sure all links are­ updated right, so no bugs pop up. Another challenge­ was about using "get_object_or_404". Think and rethink. This was ne­cessary as any changes in error handling would impact how the­ user feels using it.
